Inheritance- allows the construction of a derived class by the class 
from which it is derived. This capability of deriving one class from another.

base class- a base class is the class that is used as a basis from which other derived classes can be constructed.
Also known as a parent class.

simple inheritance-simple inheritance, the derived classes have only one base class. 

derived class- inherits the properties of the base class. Has all the data members and memeber functions from the base class.

multiple inheritance- a derived class can be derived from more than one base class. Derived classes can have more than one base class

class heirarchy-the order in which classes are derived from a base class.
